# Getting support

_Want to report a problem, but not sure where to start?_ [Create an issue](https://github.com/sleepdiary/sleepdiary.github.io/issues/new/choose) and let us know what's up.  It can be hard to know which repository an issue relates to, but we can easily transfer the issue once we've understood it.

_Want to discuss a problem without making a full report?_  [Create a discussion](https://github.com/sleepdiary/sleepdiary.github.io/discussions) and we can talk it over.  Sometimes it can take a while for an issue to mature, and we can convert discussions to issues if that's the right solution.

_Want to chat in real-time?_  [Join this Discord server](https://discord.gg/dzzT546) and ask in the *n24-projects* channel.  One of us should pop by sooner or later to help you out.
